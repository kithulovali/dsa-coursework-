Best Case Scenario in Algorithms
🔍 Definition

The best case scenario happens when the input is arranged in such a way that the algorithm takes the minimum possible number of steps.

It represents the fastest execution time of an algorithm.

Usually expressed in Big-O notation or Ω (Omega) notation.

📊 Example: Linear Search

Consider the array:

[ 7, 12, 5, 19, 3 ]


We want to search for the element 7.

✅ Best Case

The key 7 is located at the first index (0).

Only 1 comparison is required.

Array Index:   0    1    2    3    4
Array Value:  [7]  12   5   19   3
Search Key = 7


👉 Found immediately at index 0 → 1 comparison.

⏱️ Time Complexity

Linear Search → O(1) in the best case.

Other examples:

Binary Search → O(1), if the element is exactly at the middle.

Bubble Sort → O(n), if the list is already sorted (just one pass needed).

⚡ Key Takeaways

Best case = minimum number of comparisons.

It shows the fastest time an algorithm can run.

Useful in theory, but real-world performance usually depends on average case and worst case.
